### **Hi, I'm Manali Joshi!**

#### I'm a Frontend Developer and UX Designer.

>Whether it is UX design or programming a new application, I have a creative side that I have always enjoyed exploring and growing. Whether Iâ€™m working on low-fidelity wireframes or building high-quality web UI, I find ways to empathize with users through research and in-depth understanding of the problem at hand. 
>As a UX designer, I understand user experience best practices and design fundamentals to make strategically sound decisions. This makes me a right fit to build interfaces with a deep understanding of how people interact with them. Userâ€™s experience is very important to me, so I strive to craft an interface that is innovative, visually appealing, and intuitive for everyone.
